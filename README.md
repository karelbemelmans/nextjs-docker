# NextJS, Docker and ECS

My attempt to create a very clean NextJS project that created ECS infrastructure and deploys using Github Actions.

## TODO

- Everything should use the node version from `.nvmrc``
- Provide some nicer default homepage than the current NextJS default one
- Integrate CDK nicely at the top level in NextJS, not just run it from a subdirectory
- ECS deployment
