# NextJS, Docker and ECS

My attempt to create a very clean NextJS project that creates the AWS ECS infrastructure with CDK and deploys new NextJS containers using Github Actions.

## TODO

- Everything should use the node version from `.nvmrc``
- Provide some nicer default homepage than the current NextJS default one
